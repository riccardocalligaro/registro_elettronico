Ciao a tutti, è ora scaricabile registro elettronico V2.

Dopo aver abbandonato temporaneamente il progetto a causa di altri impegni lavorativi ho deciso di riprenderlo e concluderlo una volta per tutte, qui di seguito il changelog, se tutto va bene nelle prossime settimane pubblicherò sul Play store.

Version 2.0.0-dev+2

* Close #48 - New event with notification crash

* Close #47 - Workmanager issues 

* Close #46 - Black intro screen

* Close #45 - School material folder issues

* Close #43 - Notifications issues

* Rimossa intro: ora viene scaricato tutto in background senza far perdere tempo all'utente.

Il codice è stato riorganizzato completamente e si sono aggiornate le librerie + l'engine di flutter quindi è possibile notare notevoli miglioramenti di performance

Grazie a tutti e buone vacanze
